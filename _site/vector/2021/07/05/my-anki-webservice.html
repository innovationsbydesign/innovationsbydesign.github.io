<p><span>The examples in this repo are meant to accompany the to the Learn to Code - Vector Home Robot course course. This course will show you how to set up your own web server in Node.js and integrate it with Ankiâ€™s Python SDK to interact with your Vector robot. Later we will show you how you can integrate this webservice with other applications such as an Alexa skill. The exercises shown are for running Node.js on an Ubuntu 18.04 server, but Node.js is also supported on most windows platforms.</span></p>
